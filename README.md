# final_507_nutrition
final project about nutrition finder
Required package: tkinter, request, networkx, deque, matplotlib.pyplot. 
You donâ€™t need an API key as it is built in the program
File in this repo: foundationDownload.json, new.json, Revised_final.py, Test.py
In this project I have used a python file name revised_final.py to store all the function that would be needed for the project and used GUI(Graphic User Interface) to built a user interface which uses the function that was stored in the revised_final.py file.
